# I Believe Survivors

Here's the banner we made (on vinyl, with love, Sharpies, and zero support from the Soros family) translated into vectors. Please feel free to use as needed.

## Pull Requests Gratefully Appreciated

This is a hand-whittled SVG made with nothing but a text editor, because I couldn't find a usable font anywhere.  If you're an artist and something's bugging you about layout, kerning, etc., please fix the SVG or throw up a new version.  Thanks!
